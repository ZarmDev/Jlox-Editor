# Code editor to later use with a implementation of Jlox (custom programming language)!

# Building
1. Use an IDE that supports Maven
2. Use JDK version 22 or higher
3. Install the JavaFX SDK (not included with JDK)
4. In your editor, add JavaFX as a dependency

For example, in Ellipse go to Run -> Run Configurations -> Your app's class name -> Arguments and then add this to VM arguments:

--module-path pathtoyourjavafxsdklibfolder --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
# Just to remember
For the statistics part of the rubric, you should have it time the execution of running Jlox on the notepad
